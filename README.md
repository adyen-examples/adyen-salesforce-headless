# Adyen Salesforce Composable Storefront (PWA) demo

This repository showcases an integration example of some features and capabilities of Adyen Payments integration with Salesforce Composable Storefront (PWA) for B2C Commerce.

## Before you begin

Before you start this demo, make sure that:

1. You have created an Adyen Test Account
2. You have a Salesforce sandbox connected to your Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC) instance. You can create an [on-demand sandbox](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/pwa-kit-managed-runtime/guide/creating-an-on-demand-sandbox.html).
3. You have set up your sites and [SLAS](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/commerce-api/guide/authorization-for-shopper-apis.html) for Composable Storefront.
4. You have set up and know where to find [configuration values for your local environment](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/pwa-kit-managed-runtime/guide/setting-up-your-local-environment.html#configuration-values).

You can run this demo in 2 ways: using an Open Source online workspace ([Gitpod](https://github.com/adyen-examples/adyen-salesforce-pwa-headless-demo/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-online-demo-with-gitpod)) or on your [local machine](https://github.com/adyen-examples/adyen-salesforce-pwa-headless-demo/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#run-demo-locally).

> :warning: **Important Notice:** This application is not intended for production use. While the application demonstrates key functionalities, it has not been developed with the robustness, security, compatibility, and scalability necessary for production environments.

## Quick online demo with [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)

### 1. Set the environment variables in Gitpod

1. Get your Test API credentials ready. Don't have an Adyen API Key? Log in to your [Customer Area](https://ca-test.adyen.com/), Go to **Developers** > **API credentials**, and create a set of API Credendials for your integration.
2. Get all the required environment variables below, append the value of `COMMERCE_API_SITE_ID` with all Adyen environment variable names. For example, if your `COMMERCE_API_SITE_ID` is `RefArch`, your `ADYEN_API_KEY` should be `RefArch_ADYEN_API_KEY`. Go to [gitpod account variables](https://gitpod.io/variables) and add all required variables. This is a one-time setup.

```shell
    RefArch_ADYEN_API_KEY="YOUR_ADYEN_API_KEY"
    RefArch_ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT="YOUR_ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT"
    RefArch_ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY="YOUR_ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY"

    COMMERCE_API_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_MRT_COMMERCE_API_CLIENT_ID"
    COMMERCE_API_ORG_ID="YOUR_MRT_COMMERCE_API_ORG_ID"
    COMMERCE_API_SHORT_CODE="YOUR_MRT_COMMERCE_API_SHORT_CODE"
    COMMERCE_API_SITE_ID="RefArch"
    COMMERCE_API_DEFAULT_SITE="RefArch"
    SCAPI_URL="*.api.commercecloud.salesforce.com"
    OCAPI_URL="*-123.sandbox.xx00.dx.commercecloud.salesforce.com"
    ENVIRONMENT_ID="YOUR_MRT_ENVIRONMENT_ID"
    PROJECT_ID="adyen-salesforce-pwa-demo"
```

3. To setup webhooks, add the following variables to Gitpod. (Set scope: `adyen-examples/*`)

```shell
    RefArch_ADYEN_WEBHOOK_USER="YOUR_ADYEN_WEBHOOK_USERNAME"
    RefArch_ADYEN_WEBHOOK_PASSWORD="YOUR_ADYEN_WEBHOOK_PASSWORD"
    RefArch_ADYEN_HMAC_KEY="YOUR_ADYEN_HMAC_KEY"
```

4.  Optional additional variables;

```shell
    COMMERCE_API_CLIENT_ID_PRIVATE="YOUR_COMMERCE_API_CLIENT_ID"
    COMMERCE_API_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_COMMERCE_API_CLIENT_SECRET"
    SFCC_REALM_ID="YOUR_SFCC_REALM_ID"
    SFCC_INSTANCE_ID="YOUR_SFCC_INSTANCE_ID"
    SFCC_OAUTH_SCOPES="sfcc.orders sfcc.orders.rw"
```

### 2. Configure allowed origins (CORS) for Gitpod

1. In the Customer Area, add `https://*.gitpod.io` to the list of Allowed Origins associated with the Client Key to make sure the UI can load the Drop-in and Components
2. In the redirect field of [SLAS UI Admin](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/commerce-api/guide/authorization-for-shopper-apis.html#create-a-slas-client) Client settings, append a `|` character followed by `https://*.gitpod.io/callback`

```shell
    http://127.0.0.1:3000/callback|http://localhost:3000/callback|https://*.mobify-storefront.com/callback|https://*.gitpod.io/callback
```

### 3. Launch the demo on Gitpod

1. Click the button below
2. Click **Continue** to open with the default Gitpod Workspace.

## Run demo on local

You can run this demo on your local machine.

### Requirements:

-   Node v18 or later
-   npm v9 or later

### 1. Installation

```
    git clone https://github.com/adyen-examples/adyen-salesforce-pwa-headless-demo.git
```

### 2. Set the environment variables

1. Create a `./.env` file with your environment variables.

-   Copy the `./.env.example` file and rename the file to .env.

2. Set the variables in the .env file. Replace `YOUR_SITE_ID` in the variables with your Salesforce Site ID, this value is identical to the value you have for `COMMERCE_API_SITE_ID` f.e. `RefArch_ADYEN_API_KEY` where `RefArch` is your Site ID.

### 3. Configure allowed origins (CORS)

It is required to specify the domain or URL of the web applications that will make requests to Adyen.

In the Customer Area add `http://localhost:3000` to the list of Allowed Origins associated with the Client Key.

### 4. Run the application

```
    npm install
    npm run start
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to view storefront and make a test payment.

Try out the different payment methods with our [test card numbers](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/test-cards/test-card-numbers) and other payment method details.

## Webhook setup

In the Customer Area under the `Developers â†’ Webhooks` section, [create](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/#set-up-webhooks-in-your-customer-area) a new `Standard webhook`.

A good practice is to set up basic authentication, copy the generated HMAC Key and set it as an environment variable. The application will use this to verify the [HMAC signatures](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/verify-hmac-signatures/).

Make sure the webhook is **enabled**, so it can receive notifications.

### Expose an endpoint

This demo provides a simple webhook implementation exposed at `/api/webhooks/notifications` that shows you how to receive, validate and consume the webhook payload.

### Test your webhook

The following webhooks `events` should be enabled:

-   **AUTHORISATION**

To make sure that the Adyen platform can reach your application, we have written a [Webhooks Testing Guide](https://github.com/adyen-examples/.github/blob/main/pages/webhooks-testing.md)
that explores several options on how you can easily achieve this (e.g. running on localhost or cloud).
